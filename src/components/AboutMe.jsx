        Hi, Iâ€™m Jaylen Perez, a full-stack web development student at Atlas School currently in my 5th trimester. I specialize in building back-end APIs with Node.js and Python, and I love working with React and Express. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a software engineer, focusing on scalable web applications. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing basketball, hiking, fishing, and experimenting with new cooking recipes.
