        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you
          compose complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called components,
          and it manages rendering efficiently via its virtual DOM.

      <Section title="Benefits of React">
        <ul>
          <li>Declarative syntax makes UI code predictable and easier to debug.</li>
          <li>Component-based architecture promotes reusability and modularity.</li>
          <li>Virtual DOM offers high-performance updates and rendering.</li>
          <li>Large ecosystem and community support with many thirdâ€‘party libraries.</li>
          <li>Strong integration with modern toolchains and frameworks.</li>
